I was approached to build out a department. A group was in place and consisted of three individuals that worked from a backlog. I met with all of them as part of my vetting in the role. I accepted the offer and was due to begin in three months time.

In the lead time to my start date, two out of the three individuals had moved on to other opportunities. Two new folks had been hired to backfill those positions. So on my first day on the job, three out of the four people in our group, including myself, had been with the company for less than a month. This was very telling of the challenge up ahead. The churn was worrisome, the difficulties were implicit, yet the opportunity to spawn a culture within the group was prevalent.

What ensued afterwards was a lot of good timing, luck, sweat, tweaking and chance encounters. I was able to come across three additional individuals who were in search of a new challenge, that were seeking to leave their comfort zone, and that were willing to work with me. At that point, our entire group was in a sweet spot: nearly everyone was new to the company, everyone was new to each other at the same time, and the area we oversaw was in such bad shape that we were given the liberty to set it right.

We first aimed to build a working relationship with each other. We crafted a common project for all of us to contribute to. We timeboxed the initiative and we set an intended outcome that was to drive the output. We dropped the backlog and focused all our efforts onto the project. Categorically postponing requests that could not be tied back to our intended outcome.

We began having virtual daily standups - we are spread across Canada coast-to-coast. Less so to prioritize work items and discuss blockers, but rather to interact with each other synchronously with the intention to spin off into pairing sessions. We shelved standups and synchronous work the moment we built a habit of writing everything down with enough generality to onboard someone into context, yet descriptive enough for anyone to gather the learnings.

After a few months, the team is in phenomenal shape. We use chat to exchange pleasantries and we built the habit of writing about our work through lengthier format in documents. The area we oversee has seen an enormous lift. The trust between colleagues is high enough for individuals to contribute feedback to each other's work. It is very exciting to take in this success.

This team became good in large part because the individuals that compose it gave a try to a process they turned into habit. They seek clarity on the outcome. They measure their progress towards it through tangible metrics. They write extensively to dissipate assumptions. And they own the process as much as the deliverables targeted at the outcome.
