I'm a software engineer based out of Montreal, Canada. I use the handle [roverslim](https://github.com/roverslim) for personal projects and learning experiments.

I worked at [Drop Loyalty](https://www.joindrop.com/) as a Senior Engineering Manager. I was given the opportunity to influence the direction of the department and staff the focus areas. The entire data and development group being composed of roughly forty individials and a handful of contractors allowed me to remain involved in the code. I was able to split my time between supporting the indiduals I was responsible for, individual project contribution and POC (proof-of-concept) development. Our group oversaw the infrastructure deployed to AWS, the availability of the systems, individual build & deployment pipelines, surfacing performance metrics, defining SLOs (service level objectives), enabling observability, identifying contention areas, scaling the application along its growth path and streamlining developer productivity. In common parlance, the team could be coined as _infrastructure_, _production engineering_, _productivity engineering_, or _platform engineering_. During my tenure, I used the handle [drop-tomasz](https://github.com/drop-tomasz?tab=overview&from=2021-10-01&to=2022-11-01) to track my professional output.

I evolved as a Software Engineer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). I used to track my work as [tskorupa](https://github.com/tskorupa). I took part in rewriting the discount code functionality that was limited to a single coupon per checkout to a discounting engine that allowed to apply bespoke rules such as [BOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_one,_get_one_free) to the cart's content. I helped migrate the Payments account billing to support multiple currencies. I took part in the transition from metal to the cloud - specifically around Shopify's caching & queuing infrastructure. I helped with the multi-region deployments of all the cache stores and contributed to their failover strategy. I then focused my efforts on the performance of the Online Store in terms of cache thrashing. And I wrote the first interation of Shopify's integration with GitHub to enable quicker theme development.

I began my professional career as a Software Developer at [AdGear](https://adgear.com/en/). We were a small office at the time, definitely fewer than ten individuals. This provided a breeding ground of opportunity and allowed for a lot of professional growth. I wrote numerous Apache modules written in C for the delivery layer and had my first taste of ruby on rails managing customer-facing campaigns.
