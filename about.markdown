I'm a software engineer based out of Montreal, Canada. I use the handle [roverslim](https://github.com/roverslim) for personal projects and learning experiments.

I worked at [Drop Loyalty](https://www.joindrop.com/) as a Senior Engineering Manager. I was given the opportunity to set the direction and staff the infrastructure and platform capabilities. During my tenure, I used the handle [drop-tomasz](https://github.com/drop-tomasz?tab=overview&from=2021-10-01&to=2022-11-01) to track my professional output.

I evolved as a Software Engineer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/). I used to track my work as [tskorupa](https://github.com/tskorupa). I took part in rewriting the discount code functionality that was limited to a single coupon per checkout to a discounting engine that allowed to apply bespoke rules such as [BOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_one,_get_one_free) to the cart's content. I helped migrate the Payments account billing to support multiple currencies. I took part in the transition from metal to the cloud - specifically around Shopify's caching & queuing infrastructure. I helped with the multi-region deployments of all the cache stores and contributed to their failover strategy. I then focused my efforts on the performance of the Online Store in terms of cache thrashing. And I wrote the first interation of Shopify's integration with GitHub to enable quicker theme development.

I began my professional career as a Software Developer at [AdGear](https://adgear.com/en/). We were a small office at the time, definitely fewer than ten individuals. This provided a breeding ground of opportunity and allowed for a lot of professional growth. I wrote numerous Apache modules written in C for the delivery layer and had my first taste of ruby on rails managing customer-facing campaigns.
